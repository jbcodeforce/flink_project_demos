# Flink Project Demonstrations

This folder includes different Flink projects for demonstrating Flink processing, but also to support automatic migration from ksqlDN projects or Spark projects to flink using the [shift_left tool](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/shift_left_utils/coding/llm_based_translation/).

## Folder structure

* flink_projects includes a set of flink processing in the form of pipelines to demonstrate some Flink concepts, and for demonstrating pipeline management with [shift_left tool](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/shift_left_utils/pipeline_mgr/)
* spark project: a folder that includes two Spark SQL batch processing flows.
* Ksql project: a set of files to be used for testing automatic migration.
